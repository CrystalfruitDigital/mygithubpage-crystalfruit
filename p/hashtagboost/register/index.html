		<h3>Terms and Conditions : Model's Employment Contract</h3>
		<div class="terms-container" id="termsCopy">
			<b>{{user.firstName}} {{user.lastName}}</b> (hereafter "Model") and #Boost, Inc./hashtagboost.com 

(hereafter "#Boost") hereby enter into an agreement to the terms below:
<br>
Company hereby engages Model to participate in its proprietary platform where he or she may 

accept service requests for social media engagement by individuals and businesses in 

exchange for a fee. Such social media engagement may include an Instagram message, 

posting on a social media wall, doing a “shout out,” wearing a product and sending a selfie or 

picture of yourself wearing the product (for example, a T-shirt, hat or piece of jewelry) or similar 

services. Model warrants that Model is not now bound by any other contract for similar services, 

or is not subject to any restriction or non-compete obligation precluding he or she from 

participating in such services, and that Model will not enter into such a contract with any other 

company or service provider during the term of this agreement that is similar to the services of 

#Boost. Model agrees to refer all requests for the model to participate in these types of social 

media services to Company and not to compete with #Boost with a similar product or service, or 

facilitate a third party in doing so, for a period of 2 years after termination of the relationship 

between Model and #Boost.
<br>
Model must have authentic Instagram followers in the amount he or she represents when 

accepting a job. If at any time, #Boost is unable to authenticate followers, it has the right to 

withhold or terminate payments and the Model’s account.
<br>
Model must complete any job within 48 hours of accepting. The job must be posted for the

period agreed to in the job description that was accepted. The post and tagging must be 

positive, supportive and promoting the person or business requesting #Boost service (buyer). 

Model must tag that buyer in the photo.
<br>
If the job is not completed timely, Model forfeits payment and/or the job can be re-offered to 

another Model. If Model does not complete more than one job in a timely fashion, #Boost 

reserves the right to terminate the Model’s account or suspend eligibility to accept jobs for 30 

jobs.
<br>
Company agrees to pay Model 45% of all gross revenues that Model may generate through the 

platform in return for services provided to Company’s customers. This money will be paid within 

15 days following payment by the customer and providing the services by Model, whichever is 

later.
<br>
Company also agrees to additionally pay model 4% of gross revenues for the three jobs 

following a job where Model posts #Boost’s image and tags #Boost’s Instagram account, 

captioning it with a positive comment about #Boost service and adding the URL 

<a href="http://hashtagboost.com">www.HashtagBoost.com</a>. Model can do this as many times he or she desires, but only 4% can 

be earned for any particular job (they cannot be stacked or combined).
<br>
Either party may terminate this agreement at any time for any reason but any earned payments 

will still be due and payable.
<br>
Company and its customers are hereby authorized to use Model's name, likeness, description, 

biographical information, and any other information available to deliver and promote company’s 

services. Company does provide certain information its participant database to sponsors, 

advertisers and other third parties.
<br>
The laws of New York shall govern this agreement and any disputes arising from either party's 

performance.
